Visit [the website](https://lizzy.wiki/trapped/) for more information about the project.

## Unity version

We built this project for Unity version 2018.4.20f1. To enable multiplayer mode, you will need to run the NodeJS server for player data messaging.

## Running the multiplayer server

Steps:

1. Ensure you have `node` installed.
2. `cd trapped/node && npm install && npm start`

Running the game from the Unity editor will direct the WebSocket connection in Unity to your localhost IP.
