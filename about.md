Our muliplayer functionality was adapted from [this example repository on GitHub](https://github.com/valiafetisov/unity-webgl-multiplayer). We added functionality which correctly removes a player's data from the server's local storage when a player disconnects, as well as transmitting all data that is required to be shared.
