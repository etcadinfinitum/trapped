# Development Log Dated 06-02-2020

## Completed Milestones

TODO: List the work that has been recently completed here.

## Current Work

TODO: List what work is currently being done by the team.

* Victor:
* Jayden:
* Denali: I am currently still working on map refinement. Last week most of the time I had to
  * continue working on this got diverted to working on the death mechanic for our game. Now
  * that I have completed that mechanic I can resume working on other map refinements that rely
  * on that.
* Kyle:
* Lizzy: 

## Upcoming Features & Backlogged Items

TODO: List what features or ideas are on the backlog and/or will be completed next.

The features that are still in the works are a map "balance beam", that has been implmenented in a branch but did not make
it into the beta because it was very dependent on the death mechanic. Features that we wish to add are lobbies and multiple
concurrent play sessions with multiple groups of players. However, this may prove to be fruitless in the final build because
of its difficulty with websockets.

## Playtesting Analysis

TODO: Write up observations and takeaways here; we can optionally provide external links in another post or under a different directory.

## Blockers

TODO: List what obstacles are blocking development efforts.

## Reflection

TODO: Reflect on the game's state and the development process. List what is working and what is not working.
The team now has a relatively good grasp of git and how to merge new branches into the master game branch so compared to previous weeks
this has proved to be much less of an issue.
