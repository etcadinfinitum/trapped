# Development Log Dated 05-25-2020

## Completed Milestones

* Lizzy: [Generated SSL/TLS certificates for the host of our multiplayer server.]({% link _posts/2020-05-19-networking-devlog.md %})
* Lizzy: Implemented vision obscuration for players.
    * This game mechanic makes the maps more difficult (and more interesting).
    * This feature is a core tenet of our original idea, and will hopefully foster interdependence between the players as they help each other navigate and avoid obstacles.
    * We may utilize this feature in future map development and additional traps.
* TODO
* TODO

## Current Work

* Victor:
* Jayden:
* Denali:
* Kyle:
* Lizzy: Health depletion mechanics for players which become too far separated from each other; completion planned for 5/31.

## Upcoming Features & Backlogged Items

##### Networking

Our project still needs to address coordination of a single game, and prevent latecomers from joining, or some other gatekeeping mechanism that will let players assemble before being placed on the map. It would be nice to allow multiple game sessions at the same time (the way [Jackbox Party Pack does](https://www.jackboxgames.com/how-to-play/)).

##### Player Interdependency

We are getting to a point in development that we are ready to focus on how our game's design can foster player interactions and cooperation. We are looking at healthmechanics, and will be creating additional maps that have features which should be cooperatively tackled. 

##### Player Health

We have map elements and game mechanics in the pipeline that affect the player's health, and will be focusing on releasing those features in the next few days.

## Playtesting Analysis

We are excited to get some playtesters for our game in its current form, and hopefully get some actionable input about what features they like or do not like.

## Blockers

TODO: List what obstacles are blocking development efforts.

## Reflection

TODO: Reflect on the game's state and the development process. List what is working and what is not working.
